That's really nice.\n\n\"What happens in my personal life, I just want to really keep that between my closest people around me. I just have to move on.\"\n\nThe Dane added that she was not at full fitness following a knee injury and was unsure of her exact plans in the weeks ahead.\n\n\"I haven't really thought about it,\" she said. \"I was just so focused on one day at a time and one hour at a time. I haven't really thought forward.\n\n\"I need to sit down and think about how I can get my knee 100% ready.\n\n\"I want to prepare for Wimbledon, which is a big tournament and a better surface for me.\"\n\nHer next event is the grass-court tournament at Eastbourne in June."}
