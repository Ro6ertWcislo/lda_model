I felt as if I was competing.\n\nRobertson said: \"I guess it's a shame I didn't get to play Ding in the quarter-finals as we're the best two players in the world at the moment.\n\n\"If Peter plays Ding and plays like he did today, I think he will probably win. Ding will have to be very patient and maintain a good temperament.\"\n\nHe will play Marco Fu in the quarter-finals after the Hong Kong player defeated Chinese 16-year-old Zhao Xintong 6-2.\n\nChina's Liang Wenbo backed up Tuesday's win over Ronnie O'Sullivan by beating England's Mark Davis 6-1, and he will next play Scotland's Graeme Dott, who beat Norwegian Kurt Maflin 6-5.\n\nEnglishman Joe Perry beat Mark Allen of Northern Ireland 6-4 to set up a clash with Welshman Ryan Day, a 6-3 winner over Ireland's Fergal O'Brien."}
