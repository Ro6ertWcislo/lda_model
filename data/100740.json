Their reason for not migrating was because they thought they were too old and one was already married.\n\nThe women's concern with age and marital status is unsurprising.\n\nOnline discussions also stress a swift marriage upon arrival in Syria as an expectation of women.\n\nMarriage to a fighter provides a strong identity, a sense of belonging to the wider community, the Umma.\n\nThe majority of analysis presents these women as rejecting Western liberalism - and assumes the same access to these goods as other European women - confirming how little the mainstream understands the difficulties they face.\n\nThey are offered a false choice: either they get rights and feminism, or, \"tradition\" and \"faith\".\n\nAsking for both is seen within their communities and by mainstream public discourse as unreasonable.\n\nIS capitalises on this, constantly questioning the status of women in the West, highlighting battles over body images, the double bind of domestic work and paid labour, rape culture, pornography, racism, and so on.\n\nThis is not to suggest IS is feminist; for them women are not equal to men, and they reject the potential of Western liberal feminism.\n\nWomen in IS are granted little freedom to travel, work, or have public roles.\n\nAccording to a recent manifesto translated by the Quilliam Foundation think tank, women are only permitted to abandon domestic roles for fighting \"if the enemy is attacking her country and the men are not enough to protect it, and the imams give a fatwa for it\".\n\nWomen of IS are clear this time has not yet come.\n\nThis demonstrates that IS's messaging encompasses both the personal-private and the public-political.\n\nAccounts of Jihadi brides are full of hope and naive romanticism.\n\nOne undercover reporter, Anna Erelle, became a minor online celebrity once she was known as the fiancee of Bilel, a well-known European Jihadi fighter.\n\nIn IS, marriage represents more than the private union between two people.\n\nPersonal desires are combined with broader ideas of the good life, and common purpose.\n\nBint Nur, the wife of a British fighter in Syria, wrote on Ask.fm in 2014, \"women build the men and men build the Umma\".\n\nTheir personal choices - domestic chores, children, marriage - are about building a new state.\n\nAccording to the news website Vocativ, 45% of IS propaganda centres on efforts to build and sustain the burgeoning caliphate.\n\nAlong with roadworks and local infrastructure, there is messaging on traffic police, charity work, judicial systems, hospitals, and agricultural projects.\n\nFor young women travelling to Syria and Iraq the personal has broad purpose - their duty is to become founding mothers of the new state.\n\nThis contrasts with negative public discourse about young Muslims living in Europe: constantly presented as threatening, \"at risk\", alien and unwanted at worst; with little and limited future at best.\n\nIt is almost a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nChallenging IS will require more than countering their religious narrative, more than new legislation or granting new powers to the police and security services: a successful counter-radicalisation programme requires addressing the lives of young Muslim women without securitising them.\n\nToo many young Muslims are silenced by the current political atmosphere because they fear being spied on, or treated as \"already radical\" just for asking questions, which only drives them towards extremists.\n\nInstead, understand their fears and aspirations, and seek to overcome Islamophobia, discrimination, and other material disadvantages.\n\nThe forthcoming Daughters of Eve conference, run by the Muslim Women's Council is an example of this broad approach.\n\nWe must allow them to ask critical and difficult questions not only of IS, but of Britain.\n\nDr Katherine Brown is a lecturer in the Defence Studies Department at King's College London. In her work, she has examined the roles and portrayal of women in terrorism, counter-terrorism, and violent politics, and investigated Muslim women's radicalised political activism.\n\nThis World: Britain's Jihadi Brides is on BBC Two on Wednesday 8 April at 21:00 BST, and will be available afterwards on the BBC iPlayer."}
